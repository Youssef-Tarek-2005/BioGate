🔐 BioGate – Biometric IoT Security Simulation Platform
📘 Project Description

BioGate is a cybersecurity simulation project focused on biometric authentication within Internet of Things (IoT) systems.
The project aims to demonstrate how biometric-based access control can be designed, tested, and secured in a simulated environment using synthetic data only.

The system is built incrementally, starting with a basic Python prototype to validate the idea, then expanding to include machine learning, IoT device simulation, security attack modeling, camera-based authentication, and advanced visualization.

🎯 Project Objectives

🔑 Simulate biometric authentication without using real biometric data

📡 Represent IoT devices requesting access to a secured system

🤖 Use machine learning to decide authentication outcomes

🛡️ Demonstrate common cybersecurity attacks on biometric systems

🧾 Log authentication attempts and security events

🖥️ Provide a user-friendly graphical interface

📷 Enable camera-based authorization and authentication

🧊 Support optional 3D visualization for system behavior

🚧 Current Status

The project currently includes a minimal Python prototype developed to test the core concept in less than one minute of execution time.

✅ Implemented

This phase confirms the feasibility of the idea before moving to advanced development.

🧠 System Concept

BioGate treats biometric authentication as a security gateway between users and IoT devices.
Each authentication request is analyzed, validated, logged, and either accepted or rejected based on security rules and intelligent decision-making.

The project emphasizes:

🔒 Security-first design

📊 Observability and logging

🧪 Safe experimentation

🎓 Educational value

🎓 Ethical Considerations

✔ No real biometric data is collected or stored

✔ All biometric information is synthetically generated

✔ The system is designed strictly for educational and research purposes
